# Welcome to my **portfolio**

## A little about this page and how to navigate on different devices

This [site](/https://www.ejdevspot.com) was built using a base template from [madebybootstrap.com](/https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/iPortfolio/) and modified by me to show case myself as a developer, as well as any projects that are relevant to my skillset.

It is optimized for any screen size, you should know that whenm viewed on a medium screen size, the side navigation bar will not be visible on load. To provide a solution, I have included a menu icon that will appear in the top right corner that when clicked, will display the navigation menu. 

To showcase my front end ability, the contact submission form uses **EmailJS** rather than a backend server. What this means is that any submission will be recieved by my personal email, but **not** from the sender's address.
All emails come to me from **EmailJS** with the sender's name and email address, and are filtered their own folder. This elimnates any chance of submissions being filtered as junk mail. While this was the best option for me, please be sure to include the **correct name and email** in the form section.

***Note:***
- The telephone number provided is interactive. If you are on mobile, or your current device is linked to your phone via a linking app, then simply click the number and it will populate in your phone app, ready to be called. 

***If you encounter any unlisted issues, please use the contact form to alert me.***
